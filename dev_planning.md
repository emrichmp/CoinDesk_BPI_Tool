## To-Do

## Project Broken Down

### Form
[] - Inputs
    [] - profile info?
        [] - 
    [] - start date
    [] - end date
    [] - currencies

### Data Display
    Tables
        * columns:

    Charts
        * line graph to show history of data
        * another graph for another thing lol

### Component Breakdown
* reusable function component for the rows in the table - takes in props
* container componenet that holds the table
* form class component that has inputs and handles fetches - might be able to refactor this into 2 comps

### Styling - https://www.vian.ai/ (website)

[] - Use dark purple, grey black and white for color scheme
[] - add "Powered by CoinDesk" and link to price page - "https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin"
